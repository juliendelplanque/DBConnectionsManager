I am the widget representing the list of connections of DBConnectionsManager. I listen to its announcements to keep my list of connection descriptions up to date.

If your looking for the list menu appearing in the DBConnectionsManagerWidget, it is not defined here but in DBConnectionsManagerWidget>>#buildListMenuOn:.
